# Hand Gesture Recognition using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a **Hand Gesture Recognition System** using **Machine Learning** techniques. It detects and classifies different hand gestures in real-time, enabling applications such as human-computer interaction, sign language interpretation, and gesture-based control systems.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection
- Classification of multiple hand gestures
- Uses OpenCV for image processing
- Machine learning model trained on labeled hand gesture datasets
- Supports integration with various applications (e.g., home automation, gaming, virtual reality)

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Mediapipe
- **Machine Learning Model**: CNN/Random Forest/SVM (based on project implementation)
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset or publicly available datasets

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HAND-GESTURE-RECOGNITION.git
cd HAND-GESTURE-RECOGNITION
```

## Usage
1. **Train the Model** (if not using a pre-trained model)
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
2. **Run the Gesture Recognition System**
   ```bash
   python recognize.py
   ```
3. **Customize Gesture Labels**
   - Modify the `gestures.json` or dataset labels if needed.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images/videos of different hand gestures. You can use:
- A publicly available dataset (e.g., **MNIST Hand Gesture Dataset**)
- Custom dataset collected using OpenCV and stored in labeled folders

## Model Architecture
The project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classification. The architecture consists of:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- MaxPooling layers to reduce dimensions
- Fully connected layers for classification

Alternatively, a traditional **Machine Learning model** like Random Forest or SVM can also be used.

## Performance Metrics
The model is evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy**: Overall classification accuracy on test data
- **Precision & Recall**: Performance on each gesture class
- **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize classification results

## Future Improvements
- Support for more gestures
- Optimization for real-time performance
- Integration with AR/VR applications
